# Fraud-Detection
##  Project Overview
This project presents a machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions with high precision and low false-positive rates. It leverages transaction data to train predictive models capable of recognizing anomalies and suspicious behavior, making it highly valuable for banks, e-commerce, and digital payment platforms.

##  Objectives
- Detect and classify fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Minimize false alarms while maximizing detection accuracy.
- Build a scalable, interpretable, and user-friendly fraud detection system.
- Provide data-driven insights to improve financial security.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed transaction data, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
2. **EDA**: Visualized transaction patterns, feature correlations, and fraud indicators.
3. **Model Training**: Used multiple models including Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Built a responsive web application using Streamlit for real-time fraud prediction.

##  Outcomes
- Decision Trees and XGBoost showed high predictive capability.
- Achieved up to 77% accuracy with Random Forest and better fraud sensitivity with XGBoost.
- Deployed a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time prediction.
- Visualized transaction insights through interactive charts and graphs.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, XGBoost
- **Development Platforms**: Google Colab, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git (recommended)
